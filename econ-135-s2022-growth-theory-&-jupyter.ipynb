    "## 0.1. Why Are We Doing This?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we are doing this because our section leaders are overworked: teaching online takes more time and effort than teaching in person, and our section leaders were not overpaid before the 'rona arrived on these shores. Taking the bulk of the work of grading calculation assignments off of their backs is a plus—and it appears that the best way for us to do that is to distribute a number of the course assignements to you in this form: the form of a Python computer language \"jupyter notebook\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we are doing this because learning jupyter notebooks and python may well turn out to be the intellectual equivalent for you of \"eat your spinach\": something that may seem unpleasant and unappetizing now, but that makes you stronger and more capable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of years ago, I had coffee with a student who had graduated in 2007, and who attributed a large chunk of the interesting and successful career he has had in the past decade-and-a-half years—had in spite of the collapse of the job market in 2008-9—to the fact that he had been fluent in Microsoft Office when he left Berkeley. But now, he said—and I agree—it is not fluency in Word, Powerpoint, and (shudder) Excel that allows one to make oneself useful in a white-collar organization doing interesting work while one learns-by-doing, it is rather fluency in a language like Python and the ability to script hooks into various Big Data and other APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "An analogy: Back in the medieval European university, people would learn the Trivium—the 'trivial' subjects of Grammar (how to write), Rhetoric (how to speak in public), and Logic (how to think coherently)—then they would learn the Quadrivium of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music/Harmony, and Astronomy/Astrology; and last they would learn the advanced and professional subjects: Law or Medicine or Theology and Physics, Metaphysics, and Moral Philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a student would also learn two more things: how to learn by reading—how to take a book and get something useful out of it, without a requiring a direct hands-on face-to-face teacher; and (2) how to write a fine chancery hand so that they could prepare their own documents, for submission to secular courts or to religious bishops or even just put them in a form where they would be easily legible to any educated audience back in those days before screens-and-attachments, before screens-and-printers, before typewriters, before printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1999 Python programming language creator Guido van Rossem compared the ability to read, write, and use software you had built or modified yourself to search and analyze data and information collections. Guido predicted that mass programming, if it could be attained, would produce increases in societal power and changes in societal organization of roughly the same magnitude as mass literacy has had over the past several centuries. Guido may be right, and he may be wrong. But what is clear is that your lives may be richer, and you may have more options, if the data science and basic programming intellectual tools become a useful part of your intellectual panoplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Science tools may well turn out to be in the first half of the 2000s the equivalent of a _fine chancery hand_, just as a facility with the document formats and commands of the Microsoft office suite were the equivalent of a fine chancery hand at the end of the 1900s: practical, general skills that make you of immense value to most if not nearly all organizations. This—along with the ability to absorb useful knowledge without requiring hands-on person-to-person face-to-face training—will greatly boost your social power and your set of opportunities in your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are right about its value.\n",

    "Why Jupyter and Python, rather than R-studio and R, or C++ and Matlab? Because Jupyter Project founder Fernando Perez has an office on the fourth floor of Evans. Because 40% of Berkeley undergraduates currently take Data 8 and so, taking account of other channels, more than half of Berkeley students are already going to graduate literonumerate in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is fluency in something like Python in particular and data-science tools in general is becoming, for the 21st Century, the equivalent of what learning to write a fine chancery hand was if you went to Oxford or Cambridge University in the 14th Century? We do not know. We do think we should help you get ready.\n",

That number is the result....’ You might say, ‘My Quetzalcoatl! What tedium... what a job!’ To which the priest would reply, ‘That’s why we have the rules.... The rules are tricky, but they are a much more efficient way of getting the answer.... We can predict the appearance of Venus by counting beans (which is slow, but easy to understand) or by using the tricky rules (which is much faster, but you must spend years in school to learn them)’...\n",

    "As is the case with all economic models, the Basic Solow Growth Model consists of:\n",

    "* _Variables_: economic quantities of interest that we can calculate and  measure, denoted by letters (or maybe two letters) like L for the number of workers in the labor force or Y for the amount of useful goods and services produced in a year—real GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Behavioral relationships_: relationships that (1) describe how humans, making economic decisions given their opportunities and opportunity costs, decide what to do, and (2) that thus determine the values of the economic variables, represented by equations that have an economic variable on the left hand side and, on the right, a set of factors that determine the value of the variable and a rule of thumb for what that value is currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * _Parameters_: determine which out of a broad family of potential behavioral relations describes the behavior of the particular economic scenario at hand; the ability to work algebraically with parameters allows one to perform an enormous number of potential \"what-if?\" calculations very quickly and in a very small space\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Equilibrium conditions_: conditions that tell us when the economy is in a position of balance, when some subset of the variables are \"stable\"—that is, are either constant are changing in simple and predictable ways, usually represented by solutions of some system of the equations that are behavioral relationships.\n",

    "In the case of the Solow growth model, the key variable is the capital intensity of the economy, which we will write using a lower-case Greek letter kappa: $ \\kappa $. We measure $ \\kappa $ as the ratio of the capital stock of the economy $ K $, to the level of output and income $ Y $. \n",
    "\n",
    "In every economic model economists proceed with their analysis by looking for an equilibrium: a point of balance, a condition of rest, a state of the system toward which the model will converge over time. Economists look for equilibrium for a simple reason: either an economy is at its (or one of its) equilibrium position(s), or it is moving—and probably (or hopefully?) moving rapidly—to an equilibrium position. The Solow growth model is no exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once economists have found the equilibrium position toward which the economy tends to move, they then understand how the model will behave. And, if they have built the right model, it will tell you in broad strokes how the economy will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Basic Solow Growth Model, the equilibrium economists look for is an equilibrium in which the economy’s capital-output ratio $ \\kappa $ is contant, and thus the capital stock per worker, the level of income and output per worker, and the efficiency of labor are all three growing at exactly the same proportional rate—a rate that remains constant over time. We will call this rate g, for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this going by at bewildering speed? Blame it on the fact that our curriculum here in Economics is not well-designed. We want you to have the tools of economic theory to use here in this course. But we don't have time to build them from scratch. So we skate over the surface—providing a quick review to those of you who have taken Econ 100b before, and a skating-over-the-surface to those of you who have not.\n",

    "As my teacher's teacher, the Nobel Prize-winning economic historian Robert Fogel once said, the killer app of history (and economics) is counting things.\n",

    "Math is basically all about counting things. But we are very lucky, in that we stand on the shoulders of giants who have figured out how to and transmitted to us the knowledge of how to count things in incredibly powerful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such giant whose shoulders we stand on is Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (c. 780-850). The first part of his name is simply \"Muhammad, son of Moses\". The second part? It is the answer to the question: \"OK. But which Muḥammad ibn Mūsā wandering around Baghdad in the early 800s during the reign of the Kalif al-Mamun are we talking about?” The answer was: \"the one who came here from Khwārizm, and who works at the House of Wisdom established by the Kalif\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When Italians heard \"al-Khwārizmī\", they mangled it into **algorithm**. Every time you say **algorithm**, you are saying that you are undertaking the kind of step-by-step analysis that Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī taught us to do.

    "It was his work on how to repeatedly and rapidly do large numbers of similar and related calculations that allowed us to turn simple counting into the mathematics of \"what-if?\" machines. We ask the question \"what-if?\" And we then answer it be doing a large number of calculations about what might be at once, seeing which of these calculations produce ansers that satisfy whatever the consistency and coherence conditions we have imposed are, and then summarizing the results of all of them in a very small space. It becomes complicated and very hard to remember and opaque very quickly. But, at the bottom, it is just counting.\n",

To give you a feeling for the accuracy of these numbers, it comes out something like this: If you were to measure the distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it would be exact to the thickness of a human hair...\n",

If two economies have the same capital intensity, defined as the same capital-output ratio $ \\kappa $, and have the same level of technology- and organization-driven efficiency-of-labor $ E $, then the ratio of their levels of total income and output will be equal to the ratio of their labor forces $ L $.\n",

    "**2.1.2.2. Why These Rules of Thumb?**: Why did Robert Solow back in 1956 look for an algebraic formula for his production function that would satisfy these three rules-of-thumb? Economists like to simplify, ruthlessly, when they can get away with it. Rule-of-thumb (1) is a simplifying assumption: an intellectual bet that the process of aggregate economic growth is likely to look very similar as an economy goes from an income-per-capita level of 10,000 to 20,000 dollars per worker per year as when it goes from 40,000 to 80,000 dollars per worker per year. It is worth making only as long as that is in fact true—that the similarities in the aggregate overall economic growth process in different decades and at different income-per-worker levels outweigh the differences. If that were not or were to cease being the case, we should drop that rule-of-thumb assumption. So far, so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-of-thumb (2) is simply that holding other things—capital intensity and efficiency-of-labor—constant, you can always duplicate what you are doing and produce and earn twice as much.

It has no deeper implications.\n"

The economy’s capital stock had been wrecked and devastated by three years of American and British bombing and then by the ground campaigns of the last six months of the war. But in the years immediately after the war, the West German economy’s capital-output ratio rapidly grew and converged back to its prewar value. Within 12 years the West German economy had closed half the gap back to its pre-World War II growth path.

Then in 1990, at least according to this set of estimates, the absorption of the formerly communist East German state into the _Bundesrepublik_ was an enormous benefit: the expanded division of labor and return of the market economy allowed productivity in the German east to more than double almost overnight.

The average woman in India today has only half the number of children that the average woman in India had only half a century ago. The U.S. labor force in the early eighteenth century grew at nearly 3 percent per year, doubling every 24 years. Today the U.S. labor force grows at 1 percent per year. Changes in the level of prosperity, changes in the freedom of migration, changes in the status of women that open up new categories of jobs to them (Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor could not get a private-sector legal job in San Francisco when she graduated from Stanford Law School even with her amazingly high class rank), changes in the average age of marriage or the availability of birth control that change fertility—all of these have powerful effects on economies’ rates of labor-force growth.\n",

    "What effects do such changes have on output per worker Y/L—on our mea sure of material prosperity? The faster the growth rate of the labor force n, the lower will be the economy’s balanced-growth capital-output ratio s/(n + g - δ). Why? Because each new worker who joins the labor force must be equipped with enough capital to be productive and to, on average, match the productivity of his or her peers. The faster the rate of growth of the labor force, the larger the share of current investment that must go to equip new members of the labor force with the capital they need to be productive. Thus the lower will be the amount of invest ment that can be devoted to building up the average ratio of capital to output.\n",

The faster the rate of growth of the efficiency of la or, the larger the share of current investment that must go to keep up with the rising efficiency of old members of the labor force and supply them with the capital they need to be productive.

Changes in households’ fears of future economic disaster, in households’ access to credit, or in any of numerous other factors change the share of household income that is saved and invested.

And this rate has been extraordinarily variable in the long sweep of human history. And if the trends of the past century and a half ere to continue for trhe next three, we would look forward to truly cray-cray levels of abundant human wealth:\n",

    "Moreover, right now the divergences across national economies are as great as they have ever been, and orders of magnitude greater than they were three centuries ago or even one century ago. What insights can economists offer into these phenomena?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the bottom line is that economists have little that is terribly useful to say about the proportional rate $ h $ at which the human stock $ H $ of useful and valuable ideas about technology and organization increases. It would not be too much a parody to say that economists know only four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. People learn by doing: trying to produce, and succesfully producing, brings with it knowledge about how to produce more efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "2. People learn by investing: a great deal of knowledge is embodied in the particular capital goods themselves produced and deployed; if you do not invest, a great deal of your knowledge remains theoretical.\n",
    "3. People learn by researching and developing: focused attention on the process of developing technology can be very effective—much more so than simply relying on the side-effects of those whose major focus is on production itself\n",
    "4. Knowledge is non-rival: once it is generated, it can and should be spread as widely as possible, for there is no downside for society as a whole from sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that—especially that without sound and solid quantitative estimates of the size and importance of these effects and channels—is rather thin gruel given that the growth and diffusion of useful knowledge about production and organization is the big enchilada in the process of economic growth.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### <font color=\"008800\"> 6.2.1. Logical Implications</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful ideas about technology and organization are non-rival: one person's work in adding to $ H $ can rapidly benefit all—if it is allowed to spread. And attempts to keep it from spreading—to limit knowledge's distribution by somehow charging those using it a price—must violate the optimality condition that the costs imposed on people for making use of commodities reflect and match the burden that their withdrawal of the commodities from the common stock imposes on the rest of the community, for with non-rival commodities there is no such withdrawal. The insights that knowledge is key and that knowledge is non-rival are now nearly two centuries old. We can find them in in 1843: **Friedrich Engels** (1843): _Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy_ <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/df-jahrbucher/outlines.htm>: \n",
    "\n",
    ">According to the economists, the production costs of a commodity consist of three elements: the rent for the piece of land required to produce the raw material; the capital with its profit, and the wages for the labour required for production and manufacture.... [Since] capital is “stored-up labour”... two sides–the natural, objective side, land; and the human, subjective side, labour, which includes capital and, besides capital, a third factor which the economist does not think about–I mean the mental element of invention, of thought, alongside the physical element of sheer labour.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What has the economist to do with inventiveness? Have not all inventions fallen into his lap without any effort on his part? Has one of them cost him anything? Why then should he bother about them in the calculation of production costs? Land, capital and labour are for him the conditions of wealth, and he requires nothing else. Science is no concern of his.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What does it matter to him that he has received its gifts through Berthollet, Davy, Liebig, Watt, Cartwright, etc.–gifts which have benefited him and his production immeasurably? He does not know how to calculate such things; the advances of science go beyond his figures. But in a rational order which has gone beyond the division of interests as it is found with the economist, the mental element certainly belongs among the elements of production and will find its place, too, in economics among the costs of production. \n",
    "\n",
    ">And here it is certainly gratifying to know that the promotion of science also brings its material reward; to know that a single achievement of science like James Watt’s steam-engine has brought in more for the world in the first fifty years of its existence than the world has spent on the promotion of science since the beginning of time... \n",
    "\n",
    "And yet indeed it was the case that mainstream economists, for generations, paid remarkably little of their attention to \"inventiveness\". Engels was right—at least about mainstream economists' strange neglect. (I take no stance on whether Engels was right in his belief that mainstream economists cannot see the world as it is but only illusions that are caused by our particular institutional framework and convenient to those whom our current institutional framework serves most fulsomely.) Engels was right so much so that Paul Romer received the Nobel Prize in 2018 for his attempts to bring \"inventiveness\" back to the center. When **Robert Solow** (1987): _Growth Theory and After_ <https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1987/solow/lecture/> gave his Nobel lecture on the occasion of the earlier \"economic growth\" Nobel Prize, awarded in 1987, he noted that his theory had little to say about “technical change in the broadest sense” and that this was a huge flaw:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The “neoclassical model of economic growth” started a small industry... stimulated hundreds of theoretical and empirical articles... very quickly found its way into textbooks... is what allows me to think that I am a respectable person to be giving this lecture today.... Gross output per hour of work in the U. S. economy doubled between 1909 and 1949; and some seven-eighths of that increase could be attributed to “technical change in the broadest sense” and only the remaining eight could be attributed to conventional increase in capital intensity.... I had expected to find a larger role for straightforward capital formation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Solow goes on to write that his attempts to say something meaningful and important about the determinants of $ h $ failed: \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"embodiment\", the fact that much technological progress, maybe most of it, could find its way into actual production only with the use of new and different capital equipment... [and so] a policy to increase investment would thus lead... also to a faster transfer of new technology into actual production, which would [matter much].... That idea seemed to correspond to common sense, and it still does.... If common sense was right, the embodiment model should have fit the facts significantly better than the earlier one. But it did not...\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a literature, springing from Paul Romer's work in the 1980s, focusing on the implications of non-rivalry in the use of ideas: that one person's work in adding to $ H $ can rapidly benefit all. The first conclusion is that production must in some sense be subject to increasing returns. We know that if all material \"inputs\" were to double then, since the new inputs could just do the same things as the old ones, production would at least double. In knowledge production, however, pursuing the same lines of inquiry and thus making all the same discoveries twice would be silly. Doubled material inputs with doubled effort devoted to knowledge creation should therefore more than double output. An economy in which non-rival knowledge is important will therefore exhibit _scale effects_: size matters, and in a good way for growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The useful literature can be seen as building on this first conclusion.\n",

    "**Theory** (1993): Non-rivalry in the use of and non-crowding in the production of useful ideas about technology and organization are the fundamental underlying assumptions of the first milestone to visit on our path through the literature: Michael Kremer: **Michael Kremer** (1993) _Population Growth and Technological Change: One Million B.C. to 1990_ <https://delong.typepad.com/files/kremer-million.pdf>:\n",
    "\n",
    ">The long-run history of population growth and technological change is consistent with the population implications of models of endogenous technological change... a highly stylized model in which... the growth rate of technology is proportional to total population... the Malthusian assumption that population is limited by the available technology, so that the growth rate of population is proportional to the growth rate of technology. Combining these assumptions implies that the growth rate of population is proportional to the level of population.... The prediction that the population growth rate will be proportional to the level of population is broadly consistent with the data... until recently.... If population grows at finite speed when income is above its steady state... per capita income will rise over time. If population growth declines in income at high levels of income, as is consistent with a variety of theoretical models and with the empirical evidence, this gradual increase in income will eventually lead to a decline in population growth.... As the model predicts, the growth rate of population has been propor- tional to its level over most of history.... Among technologically separate societies, those with higher initial population had faster growth rates of technology and population...\n",

And, indeed, up to 1900 the rate of change of the human population is indeed roughly proportional to the square of the population—as long as we start not with the invention of agriculture but with the invention of writing, and with a hiccup as the Roman and Han empires collapsed in the second third of the first millennium. After 1900 things fall apart: increasing populations and the increasing ability of people to use technology and wealth to help their investigations do not pay dividends, either in further accelerating population growth or in increasing the rate of growth of global incomes.\n",
